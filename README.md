## Functional specification
> Describe your project concretely. The project proposal should describe what core functionality your project web application intends to deliver. Don't mention every little detail and don't consider this a contract - this is for us to help you define a suitable scope in the course. Also note that this is not a contract that you should fulfil. You will be examined only on the end result.
